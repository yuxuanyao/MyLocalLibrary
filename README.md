# MyLocalLibrary
Django Library Webapp

This app allows librarians to add authors, add books, see all borrowed books, and assign book instances to library members with the admin site. Library members are able to see their borrowed books. Everyone, regardless of membership, is able to see the list of all books and authors. 

The site does not have a sign up option yet, and is not yet responsive. I hope to add these features in the coming months.
